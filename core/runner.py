MiniMax-H3 T2VA/FL2VA runner.

Loading strategy (see dev_notes/handoff-minimax-h3.md and diffusers-server CLAUDE.md
#33/#46/#47 for the constraints this follows):

- This box has 96GB VRAM but only ~94GB host RAM. The big components add up to ~144GB
  (text_encoder bf16-native ~66.7GB -- measured on GPU, the checkpoint shards are
  already bf16 -- transformer bf16 ~66.3GB, vae+audio_vae fp32 ~11GB), which fits in
  neither VRAM nor host RAM at once. `ComponentsManager.enable_auto_cpu_offload()`
  keeps every component CPU-resident as its steady state (accelerate hooks only move
  the *active* one to GPU), so it would try to hold all ~144GB in RAM simultaneously --
  not possible here.

- **Unified-memory boxes (GB10 / DGX Spark) break the premise above** (2026-08-12): there
  VRAM and host RAM are one pool, so "resident on GPU" and "resident in RAM" subtract from
  the same budget and none of the CPU-parking tricks below free anything. The saving grace
  is that the pool is large (128.45GB): `none` mode's cycling peak (~78GB) and bnb-4bit's
  steady state (~87GB) both fit. What does NOT fit is loading the transformer first and
  then quantizing the 32B TE from its bf16 shards -- that got the process OOM-killed, and
  is why `preload_all()` now loads the TE first and why `_preflight_room()` exists.

There are two loading strategies, selected by the `H3_TE_QUANT` env var:

`H3_TE_QUANT=none`: the two 66GB models cycle through GPU per request, with
  the small fp32 VAEs (~11GB) permanently resident:
    encode phase : [vae 11GB + text_encoder 66GB]   (transformer dropped if resident)
    denoise/decode: [vae 11GB + transformer 66GB]   (TE dropped right after encoding)
  Each drop frees the CUDA model in place (no .to("cpu") staging -- that would take
  ~30s, evict page cache and push the box into swap, observed on the first probe run).
  Reloads are served from disk/page cache at ~16-40s per model, i.e. ~1 load/free cycle
  per generation for each big model -- the "short window" pattern CLAUDE.md sanctions,
  not the banned "swap the whole module every step" pattern. The steady state between
  requests keeps transformer + VAEs resident (77GB). Overhead: ~37s TE reload +
  ~26s transformer reload per request.

`H3_TE_QUANT=bnb-4bit` (default; A/B verified 2026-08-04 -- same-seed frames and audio
  show no visible/audible degradation vs bf16 TE, and requests drop 245s -> 185s):
  the text_encoder is quantized to NF4 (bitsandbytes,
  compute_dtype=bf16) at startup and stays GPU-resident permanently -- bnb 4bit models
  cannot be moved between devices, so "load once, keep forever" is the only option for
  them anyway. Measured size: ~21.0GB (not the ~18GB originally estimated). The
  transformer (66.3GB) also stays resident between requests: no more per-request TE<->
  transformer swap. That leaves transformer+TE-nf4 = ~87.5GB resident during encode/
  denoise, which does not leave enough headroom for vae+audio_vae(11GB, permanently
  resident in the `none` path) plus activation buffers within this card's ~95.6GB. So
  in this mode the VAEs are NOT permanently resident: they live on CPU by default and
  are moved to GPU only for their active phase (keyframe encode / video+audio decode),
  then moved back to CPU right after. **Unified-memory boxes invert this** (2026-08-12,
  `H3_VAE_RESIDENT="auto"`): parking on CPU frees nothing there, and the `.to(DEVICE)`
  copy leaves the CPU original alive, so the round trip *raises* peak pressure by ~11GB
  instead of lowering it -- so there the VAEs stay GPU-resident and `_vae_to_gpu`/
  `_vae_to_cpu` become no-ops. See `H3_VAE_RESIDENT`'s own comment.
  A second, sharper constraint was found by measurement, not by the original estimate:
  transformer(66.3) + TE-nf4(21.0) + vae pair(11.0) = ~98.5GB *before* any decode
  activation buffer is even counted -- already over the card's ~95.6GB. Keeping all
  three resident through decode OOM'd in practice ("Tried to allocate 30.00 MiB" with
  the allocator already pinned at 93.7GB). Since the transformer is not touched by
  either decode step (MiniMaxH3VideoDecodeStep / MiniMaxH3AudioDecodeStep only use
  vae/audio_vae/video_processor), it is dropped for the ~9s decode window and reloaded
  right after, restoring the transformer+TE-nf4 steady state before the next request.
  None of this is the banned "swap a 60GB+ module every step" pattern (CLAUDE.md #33):
  every move is a single one-way trip bounded to one specific phase (keyframe encode,
  decode, or the reload right after), the same "short window, small object" shape the
  `none` path already uses for its own TE/transformer cycle -- just sliced along a
  different phase boundary (decode instead of encode) and applied to the VAEs plus,
  when decode is the phase in question, the transformer too.
  Overhead avoided: no more per-request TE reload (was ~37s) and no more per-request
  transformer reload *around encode* (was ~26s). Overhead added: ~1 VAE round trip
  in/out of GPU per request (small, fp32, ~11GB, PCIe-bound, no disk I/O) plus one
  transformer drop+reload around the decode window specifically (~10-26s, page-cache
  warm) -- still net faster per request since the TE load is fully eliminated and it
  replaces what used to be *two* full big-model reloads with one.

- video VAE decode runs under a float16 autocast internally (diffusers' own
  MiniMaxH3VideoDecodeStep) even though its weights are float32. audio_vae must stay
  float32 end-to-end: casting it to bf16 is a known upstream bug that makes generated
  audio ~20dB too quiet, so we never touch its dtype after loading fp32.
- The video VAE ships with spatial tiling enabled by default (`use_tiling=True`,
  256px tiles, verified in autoencoder_kl_minimax_h3.py) and runner.py never disables
  it, so tiled decode is already active in both modes -- there is no extra "enable
  tiling" step needed for decode-peak reduction here.

`H3_LOWVRAM=1` (opt-in, default "0" leaves every mode above byte-for-byte unchanged):
  a third loading strategy, orthogonal to `H3_TE_QUANT`/`H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT` (it
  forces TE_QUANT=bnb-4bit's VAE-parks-on-CPU behaviour and requires
  H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8, see H3_LOWVRAM's own module-level comment), for
  48GB-class cards where TE-nf4 (21GB) + transformer-int8 (34GB) = 55GB already does
  not fit together. Steady state between requests is "nothing big resident" (only the
  small VAE pair, parked on CPU). Phase x resident-set table for a t2va request
  (`generate()`'s lowvram branch):

    entry         : [nothing big -- any resident transformer/transformer_ref is freed]
    encode        : [TE-nf4 21GB]                      (transformer freed if resident)
    (TE freed)
    denoise       : [transformer-int8 34GB + ~5GB activations ~= 39GB]  (TE freed)
    (transformer freed)
    decode        : [vae pair ~11GB + decode buffers]  (transformer freed, TE freed)
    (vae parked back on CPU; nothing reloaded "for next time")

  ref2va is the same shape with an extra reference-VAE-encode phase between text-encode
  and denoise (needs `vae` on GPU while TE is *already* freed -- see
  `generate_ref2va()`'s lowvram branch for the `_execution_device` resolution note this
  requires, same "freeing TE makes `vae` the next resolved module, so bring vae onto
  GPU either before or in the same breath as freeing TE" pattern `force_free_te`
  already established for bnb-4bit/int8-both-resident mode above) and denoises against
  `transformer_ref` instead of `transformer`.

  This pays TE-load (~15-40s) + transformer-load (~35-40s, torchao int8 quantization
  happens inline during this load) on *every* request -- there is no cross-request
  steady state to amortize against, unlike every mode above. See README.md for the
  measured per-phase timing breakdown and the peak-VRAM verification against a VRAM
  ballast.

# exactly 50 layers makes `hidden_states[50]` the *last* entry of the captured tuple.
# `Qwen3VLTextModel.forward` is wrapped in `@capture_outputs` (transformers'
# output_capturing.py) with its default `tie_last_hidden_states=True`, which
# unconditionally overwrites the *last* captured hidden_states entry with
# `outputs.last_hidden_state` -- the value AFTER the model's final `self.norm(...)`
# call. In the real 64-layer checkpoint, index 50 is nowhere near the last entry (index
# 64), so this substitution never touches it and `hidden_states[50]` is genuinely the
# raw (pre-norm) output of `layers[49]`, matching what MiniMax-H3 was trained to
# condition on. Truncating to exactly 50 layers makes index 50 the *only* (and thus
# last) entry, silently swapping it for the post-norm value instead -- reproduced by
# this task's own probe (max abs diff ~1.5e4 against the real 64-layer model's
# `hidden_states[50]`, i.e. not quantization noise, a genuinely different number) and
# fixed by keeping one extra layer (51 built, `layers[50]` executes but its output is
# simply never read) so index 50 sits mid-stack again. Verified bit-identical
# (`torch.equal`, both bf16 and bnb-4bit nf4) against the unpruned model's
# `hidden_states[50]` after this fix. This is exactly the failure mode
# `get_qwen3vl_prompt_embeds`'s own guard (`if num_layers <= text_encoder_layer: raise
# ValueError(...)`, see encoders.py -- this used to be `MiniMaxH3TextEncoderStep.
# encode_prompt`'s guard pre-PR#14355, same check, moved to the new module function) was
# written to catch -- pruning to 50 would have raised there; 51 is the smallest value
# that both passes that guard and sidesteps the tie_last_hidden_states substitution.
#
# Applied in `_load_text_encoder()` via `config=` passed straight into
# `load_components()` (same per-component-kwarg dict shape already used for TE's
# `BitsAndBytesConfig`/`device_map`) -- `ComponentSpec.load()` forwards any kwarg that
# is not one of its own loading fields (pretrained_model_name_or_path/subfolder/

# (transformer/transformer_ref/TE all freed; only the small VAE pair, ~11GB, and only
# while parked on CPU -- same as bnb-4bit's own VAE placement, see `_ensure_vaes`).
# Each request pays TE-load + transformer-load from scratch (see `generate()`'s

# (transformer alone, ~34+~5GB activations -> ~39GB) -> free transformer -> VAE to GPU

# GPU-resident, the transformer is loaded once (CPU-resident, quantized in place via
# `device_map="cpu"` + torchao's `Int8WeightOnlyConfig` -- confirmed this does NOT hit
# torchao's cpu-offload skip-quantize path, since a plain string device_map becomes
# `{"": torch.device("cpu")}`, not a per-module dict with the *string* "cpu" as a
# value, which is the only thing `TorchAoHfQuantizer.validate_environment` checks for)
# and kept resident in host RAM for the life of the process via
# `enable_group_offload(block_level, num_blocks_per_group=1, use_stream=True)`, which
# streams ~1-2 of its 50 blocks (~0.68GB each) onto GPU at a time during denoise. This
# is diffusers' own decorator-based hook mechanism, not a CLAUDE.md-banned whole-module
# CPU<->GPU swap: the "resident" location for a group-offloaded module IS the CPU side,
# and the hooks manage small per-block GPU visits automatically.
#
# Requires H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8 (bf16's 66.3GB transformer alone is already
# larger than a 48GB card with headroom for anything else) -- if the transformer quant
# was left at its own default ("none") while H3_LOWVRAM is set, this is auto-upgraded
# to "int8" below (rather than silently running an unfittable bf16 config) UNLESS the

# refuse to even attempt that load if host RAM is already tight, rather than silently
# risking the swap-storm/OOM-killer incident CLAUDE.md #33 (this project's sibling
# diffusers-server repo) documents from a past project loading a large module the
# wrong way. Checked once, right before the first group-offload transformer load
# (`_ensure_transformer_group`), not at import time (RAM usage can shift between
# process start and first request).
# 40GB (default) covers the *unpinned* CPU load (~34GB, `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=1`)
# with a thin margin, but the *default* path (`H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=0`, see that
# var's own comment for why it is the default despite the name) eagerly pins the whole
# transformer at `enable_group_offload()` time right after, measured to cost an
# additional ~14-16GB of available RAM on top of the ~32GB the plain CPU load itself
# used (avail_gb dropped 61.0->58.8 during load, then 58.8->45.3 during the pin step, in
# this task's own probe against the real transformer) -- so the *actual* peak
# requirement for the default configuration is closer to ~48GB than 40GB. 40GB is kept
# as the floor (matches this var's literal meaning: do not even start the CPU load
# below this) rather than raised to 48GB by default, since `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM=1`
# remains available as an explicit lower-RAM (but slower-denoise) opt-out for boxes
# between 40-48GB of RAM -- raise this explicitly (e.g. to 48) if running the default

# `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` (diffusers' own default) skips eagerly pinning

# hooks/group_offloading.py), deferring pinning to every single onload instead
# (`_pinned_memory_tensors()`, called from `_onload_from_memory()` whenever
# `use_stream=True`). For torchao's `Int8Tensor` (this mode's transformer weight type),
# that deferred pin path is broken: `Int8Tensor.qdata.pin_memory()` raises `RuntimeError:
# cannot pin 'torch.cuda.CharTensor' only dense CPU tensors can be pinned` on every
# single denoise step's block onload -- reproduced first against the real server (a
# t2va request failing inside the FIRST transformer_blocks forward) and then isolated
# down to a minimal dummy int8-quantized nn.Linear stack, confirming
# `use_stream=True + low_cpu_mem_usage=True` is the unconditional trigger (both
# `use_stream=False` and `low_cpu_mem_usage=False` independently avoid it -- see the
# probe scripts' own output for the full traceback and A/B). `low_cpu_mem_usage=False`
# was chosen over `use_stream=False` as this mode's actual default because it also
# measured ~4-5x faster per-block onload against the real transformer (pinned-memory
# H2D copies do not need to wait on a pageable-memory staging copy first): 0.04-0.07s
# vs 0.1-0.26s onload, and offload dropped to ~0s (pinned `cpu_param_dict` tensors are
# reused directly instead of a fresh `.to(cpu)` copy each time). The cost is paid once,
# up front, at `enable_group_offload()` time instead of amortized per-step: pinning the
# full ~34GB int8 transformer took an extra ~22s and reduced available host RAM by
# ~15.7GB in that same measurement (page-locked memory cannot be swapped out, unlike the
# `low_cpu_mem_usage=True` path's plain pageable CPU tensors) -- `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_MIN_RAM_GB`'s

# transformer's `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` under int8 quant; `H3_INT8_MODULES_TO_NOT_CONVERT`
# does not skip them) has no registered `aten.cat` kernel, so `torch.cat([to_q.weight,
# to_k.weight, to_v.weight])` fails outright, before any group-offload hook is even
# consulted (so this is not the "wrap LoRA before enable_group_offload()" ordering fix
# that helped a sibling project, diffusers-server CLAUDE.md #44 -- reordering cannot fix
# a missing kernel). Confirmed identical for `H3_LOWVRAM=1` and `H3_LOWVRAM=group` (both
# force int8), each failing loudly with a 500 and no VRAM leak or lasting corruption
# (a follow-up plain, non-turbo generation succeeded right after on the same server) --
# rejected below with a loud error rather than silently risking a wrong quantize-then-
# adapt order, the failure mode CLAUDE.md #47's "LoRA loaded after fp8 cast raises
# NotImplementedError" entry warns about for a sibling project's own fp8 base.
#
# turbo=1 + upscale=1 (hires-fix), by contrast, IS verified to work (same task, see
# `core/settings.py`'s `validate_instant_settings_for_upscale()` docstring for the full
# numbers) -- no structural conflict: `apply_instant_settings()`'s turbo wrap runs once
# the transformer is confirmed resident and well before hires-fix's own two-pass split,
# and hires-fix's FBC bookkeeping calls are already no-ops whenever turbo forces
# `effective_cache` to "none".
#
# Turbo changes three more things, all gated on this same flag (see `generate()`):
# the default `num_inference_steps` becomes 8 (matches the LoRA author's community-
# verified "8 steps works, 4-7 does not" finding, itself hedged in the README as
# possibly a ComfyUI-sampler artifact rather than a LoRA limit -- this project's own
# verification found no audio breakage even at 4 steps, see README); FirstBlockCache
# (`H3_CACHE=fbc`) is force-disabled regardless of its own env var (a handful of steps
# leaves no redundant-computation window for FBC's residual-similarity skip to safely
# exploit, and caching on top of an already-4-8-step trajectory risks compounding drift
# for no measured benefit); the video/audio schedulers' `shift` is left completely
# untouched (both already default to 12.0/3.0 -- `scheduler_config.json` on disk and
# `MiniMaxH3SetTimestepsStep`'s own docstring both confirm this, and this task's own
# verification found the LoRA author's reference sampler uses the identical two
# constants -- so there is nothing to reconfigure here, unlike a naive port from a
# scheduler that defaults elsewhere).

    PR #14355 (f37ab93) removed `encode_prompt` entirely -- there is no longer a single

    already-tokenized presentation (`token_ids`/`vision_inputs`), not a prompt string.
    This function ports the presentation-building half of both `__call__` methods back
    into one place (read line-for-line from encoders.py as part of this migration; the
    tokenization shape -- `"<Picture i>: "` label + vision block per keyframe, prompt
    verbatim, no chat template, no special tokens -- is unchanged from the old

    run-time low-rank delta (see `_TurboLoRALinear`), wrapping every Linear the checkpoint
    adapts (see `_turbo_lora_key_map`'s docstring for the full derivation).

    Fuses every `MiniMaxH3Attention` submodule's Q/K/V projections into `to_qkv` first
    (`attn.fuse_projections()`, a diffusers-native, weight-preserving op -- see
    `AttentionModuleMixin.fuse_projections`) since the checkpoint's `qkv_proj` LoRA targets
    the fused projection, not the three separate ones diffusers builds by default. This is
    required for the LoRA's `attn.qkv_proj` delta to land on the same activation the
    checkpoint's own training run saw; diffusers' unfused `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` triple has no
    single matching Linear for a fused-QKV LoRA to attach to.

    IMPORTANT (found by this task's own verification, not assumed from the diffusers
    docstring): `fuse_projections()` COPIES `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v`'s weights into a new
    `to_qkv` Linear but does NOT delete the three originals (`unfuse_projections()` is the
    only place that ever removes an attribute, and it only ever removes `to_qkv`, never
    puts `to_q`/`to_k`/`to_v` back -- read in `diffusers/models/attention.py`). Left alone,
    this leaves every attention module holding BOTH the fused and unfused weights at once
    -- reproduced on this task's first server-integration attempt: the transformer's own
    resident size grew from the expected ~66.3GB to 79.08GB after this function ran (an
    extra ~12.8GB, consistent with Q+K+V's combined size roughly matching to_qkv's), which
    then OOM'd the very next component load (TE-nf4, ~21GB) with the card almost full.
    `del module.to_q / to_k / to_v` right after fusing reclaims that duplicate memory --
    safe because `to_qkv`'s weight is an independent concatenated copy (`torch.cat(...)`
    inside `fuse_projections()`, not a view), not an alias into the three originals.

    Idempotent is NOT guaranteed by design: this is meant to run exactly once, right after
    a fresh (un-adapted) transformer load -- see the `H3_TURBO_LORA` module comment and its
    call site in `_ensure_transformer`. Calling it twice on the same module would wrap an
    already-`_TurboLoRALinear`-wrapped module a second time (harmless numerically -- the
    LoRA delta would just apply twice -- but wasteful and not the intended usage) and the
    second `fuse_projections()` call would be a no-op (`fused_projections` is already True).

    Returns the number of Linear layers wrapped (259 for this checkpoint: 50 blocks x 5 +
    2 token_refiner blocks x 4 + 1 final_layer, see `_turbo_lora_key_map`'s docstring),
    which the caller logs and can sanity-check against the checkpoint's own key count.

        process, exactly like `bnb-4bit` TE's own "load once, keep forever" shape (see
        `_load_text_encoder`'s docstring: bnb 4bit modules cannot be `.to()`-moved
        between devices either, so reload-from-scratch is the only alternative there;
        here it is simply unnecessary, since a group-offloaded module's GPU visits are
        already small and self-managed by diffusers' own hooks).

        Design, verified against this file's actual constraints by
        `scripts/probe_group_offload.py` before being wired in here (see that script's
        own docstring and this task's write-up for the full reasoning):

        1. `device_map={"transformer": "cpu"}` + `TorchAoConfig(Int8WeightOnlyConfig)`.
           A plain string device_map value becomes `{"": torch.device("cpu")}` inside
           `from_pretrained` (see `modeling_utils.py`'s device_map normalization) -- a
           single-entry dict whose *value* is a `torch.device` object, not the string
           `"cpu"`. `TorchAoHfQuantizer.validate_environment` only sets its
           offload-skip-quantize flag (`self.offload = True`, which makes
           `check_if_quantized_param` skip quantizing anything placed on `"cpu"`) when
           `"cpu" in device_map.values()` -- a `torch.device("cpu") == "cpu"` comparison
           is `False` in Python, so that flag is never set here and every eligible
           linear layer DOES get quantized to torchao's `Int8Tensor`, even though every
           weight lands on CPU. Confirmed empirically: probe scan found 370/370 eligible
           linear layers as `Int8Tensor` (none fell back to plain bf16 `Tensor`), and RAM
           dropped by ~32GB during the load (consistent with the already-measured ~34GB
           int8 size measured on GPU in `H3_TRANSFORMER_QUANT=int8` mode).
        2. `enable_group_offload(onload_device=cuda, offload_device=cpu,
           offload_type="block_level", num_blocks_per_group=1, use_stream=True,
           low_cpu_mem_usage=H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM)` -- the CPU-then-offload
           ordering (module loaded CPU-side *first*, group offloading layered on top
           after) is the same shape diffusers-server's sibling project (CLAUDE.md
           #33/#34/#37) already established as correct: the hooks are in place before
           anything ever tries to move the whole ~34GB module onto GPU at once (which is
           the failure mode "block-level group offload" exists to avoid in the first
           place). 50 transformer_blocks at ~0.68GB (int8) each means
           `num_blocks_per_group=1` with `use_stream=True`'s double-buffered prefetch
           keeps only ~1-2 blocks (~1.4GB) GPU-resident at any moment during denoise, not
           the full 34GB. `low_cpu_mem_usage` defaults to `False` here -- see
           `H3_GROUP_OFFLOAD_LOW_CPU_MEM`'s own module-level comment for why: diffusers'
           own default (`True`) combined with `use_stream=True` hits a real bug for
           torchao's `Int8Tensor` (`RuntimeError: cannot pin 'torch.cuda.CharTensor'
           only dense CPU tensors can be pinned`, reproduced against both a minimal
           dummy int8 stack and the real transformer, isolated to exactly this
           combination), and the fix (`low_cpu_mem_usage=False`, which eagerly pins
           `cpu_param_dict` once at this call instead of once per onload) also measured
           ~4-5x faster per-block onload as a side benefit.
        3. FBC (`H3_CACHE=fbc`) and the attention backend (`H3_ATTN_BACKEND=sage`) are
           applied exactly as in every other mode: both are independent hook layers
           (FBC decides whether to skip a block's compute at all; group offloading
           decides whether that block's weights are already GPU-resident; the attention
           backend only changes what happens inside a block's own attention call once it
           does run) -- diffusers' `HookRegistry` supports multiple hooks per module by
           design (see `hooks/hooks.py`), and this is exactly what the task's own
           empirical verification (this run) is checking end-to-end, not just asserting.

        No RAM-vs-VRAM cycling for the transformer itself is needed once this call
        returns -- `_free_transformer`/decode-window drops elsewhere in this file are
        skipped for `H3_LOWVRAM_GROUP` (see the `generate()`/`generate_ref2va()` call
        sites), since group offloading already keeps VRAM usage low without a full
        drop+reload.

        of hires-fix, and rebuild the packed-sequence layout (row_timestep_plan, position_ids,
        token_tags, video/audio/text_indices) for the new resolution's *remaining* timesteps.

        IMPORTANT (found during this task's own verification, not assumed from the reference
        up front): this upscales the pass-1 **x0 estimate** (the model's denoised prediction),
        not the noisy `x_t` sample directly, then re-noises the upscaled x0 at the pass-2
        starting sigma with fresh noise. The first implementation bilinear-interpolated
        `block_state.latents` (the noisy `x_t`) directly, matching a naive reading of "spatial
        2x upscale of the video latent between passes" -- this reliably produced a checkerboard/
        moire-corrupted decode (reproduced and isolated with `scripts/debug_vae_direct.py`:
        the corruption persists even with `vae.disable_tiling()`, so it is not a VAE tiling-seam
        artifact, and it is present in a *direct* decode of the interpolated latent with zero
        pass-2 steps run, so it is not something pass 2 could ever "clean up" -- if anything pass
        2 amplifies it into total noise because the model is being asked to denoise a `x_t` whose
        noise component has been low-pass-filtered by the bilinear resize, which is off-distribution
        for what the model expects a genuine forward-process sample to look like at that sigma).
        Re-reading the ComfyUI reference's own description in light of this (`utils.py`, fetched
        during this task): its pass 1 is read from `SamplerCustomAdvanced`'s `denoised_output`
        (already the x0 estimate, not the noisy latent) and its upscale node explicitly re-noises
        via `model_sampling.noise_scaling(sigma_start, fresh_noise, upscaled_latent)` afterward --
        i.e. the reference *never* interpolates a noisy sample either. This implementation follows
        that shape once translated to this scheduler's own `scale_noise(sample, timestep, noise)`
        API (`x_t = t*x0 + (1-t)*noise`, this repo's rectified-flow convention, see
        scheduling_minimax_h3.py): x0 is reconstructed here from the last pass-1 step's
        `(sample, model_output, t)` via the same formula `MiniMaxH3Scheduler.step()` uses
        internally (`denoised = sample + (1-t)*model_output`) since the block wrapper discards
        it, that x0 is what gets bilinear-interpolated, and the result is re-noised with **fresh**
        noise at pass 2's first timestep before pass 2's loop begins.

        Only the *video* rows have spatial extent (`(t, h, w)` -> `F.interpolate`); the audio
        rows are channel-major and carry no height/width coordinate at all (see
        `build_packed_sequence` in packing.py -- their rotary position only has a time axis
        and a fixed left/right width-grid endpoint pin), so they are left completely
        untouched here, matching the reference ComfyUI node's audio pass-through
        (`audio_denoise=0` behaviour) -- this task's design choice per the brief.

        This function assumes `num_condition_video_rows == 0` / `num_condition_audio_rows
        == 0` (t2va only, no keyframe conditioning rows) -- enforced by the `ValueError`
        `generate()` raises for fl2va + upscale before this is ever reached.

        PR #14355 (f37ab93) note: `packing.py` is gone. `patchify_video_latents` survives
        as a plain module function in before_denoise.py (imported below, unchanged
        signature/behaviour). `build_packed_sequence` and `build_row_timesteps` moved onto
        their respective step classes as `@staticmethod`s and both grew new required
        arguments (`audio_channels`/`audio_tag`/`video_tag` for the former, an explicit
        `video_indices`/`audio_indices`/... row-index shape for the latter, replacing the
        old `MiniMaxH3PackedSequence` namedtuple-style return with a plain positional
        tuple) -- both call sites below are updated for the new signatures.
        `unpatchify_video_tokens` has **no replacement upstream at all** (deliberately, per
        this project's "prefer self-implementation over vendoring" policy) -- it is ported
        verbatim below as a private module-level helper (`_unpatchify_video_tokens`),
        copied from this repo's own vendored copy of the pre-PR#14355 packing.py (the
        algorithm is also, byte-for-byte, what `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep.__call__` now
        inlines in decoders.py -- confirmed by reading both).

        償却して生成する(物語の場面画像の連番生成用)。

        `generate(still=True)` を N 回呼ぶと毎回 TE ロード(~75-97s) + transformer
        ロード(~35-40s)を払う(lowvram=1 は「リクエスト間は何も常駐させない」設計の
        ため)。この関数は同じ choreography を **位相順** に並べ替える:

            entry   : [nothing big resident]
            encode  : [TE-nf4 21GB]   全場面の setup/エンコード/layout/latents/timesteps
            (TE freed)
            denoise : [transformer-int8 34GB]   全場面を順にデノイズ
            (transformer freed)
            decode  : [vae pair]   全場面を順にデコード → PNG/mp4 保存
            (vae parked; 何も再ロードしない = lowvram=1 の定常状態そのまま)

        各位相の常駐セットは generate() の lowvram 分岐と同一なので、VRAM 予算は
        1枚生成と変わらない(場面ごとに増えるのは潜在とprompt_embedsのみ。22フレームの
        潜在は2フレーム相当で場面あたり数十MB)。実測の狙い: ~157s/枚 → ~35-40s/枚。

        場面間で共有される可変状態のリセット(このタスクで確認した2点):
        - スケジューラ: sigmas/timesteps の**値**は全場面で同一(同じ幾何・ステップ数)
          なので、encode 位相で場面ごとに timesteps_step を回した後は、デノイズ直前に
          `_step_index = None` に戻すだけでよい(`MiniMaxH3Scheduler.step()` は
          `_step_index is None` のとき timestep 値から index を再導出する --
          scheduling_minimax_h3.py L262-263 で確認)。video/audio 両方に適用
        - FirstBlockCache: generate() と同じく場面ごとに `_reset_stateful_cache()` +
          `cache_context("h3")`(前の場面の残差で新しい場面の step 0 が誤スキップ
          しないように)

        seed は全場面共通(= 手動で同一 seed を N 回叩くのと同じ挙動。場面ごとの
        再現性がバッチの構成に依存しない)。decode 位相は場面ごとに PNG/mp4 を保存
        しながら進むので、途中で失敗しても完了済み場面のファイルは outputs/ に残る
        (レスポンス自体は 500)。decode 例外時の steady state 復元は generate() と
        同じ(lowvram=1 では VAE を CPU に戻すだけ)。

        `H3_LOWVRAM=1` 以外のモードでは呼ばない(他モードは大モデルが常駐するため

        Runs ref2va: joint video+audio generation conditioned on an ordered list of
        `MiniMaxH3ImageReference` / `MiniMaxH3VideoReference` / `MiniMaxH3AudioReference`
        instances (up to 9/3/3, 12 total).

        `still=True` は参照付き静止画モード (ref2i): `seconds` を無視して `still_frames`
        (STILL_FRAME_CHOICES) の超短尺を生成し、中央フレームを PNG に書き出す。
        キャラクター参照から場面ごとの一貫した静止画を作る用途
        (2026-08-07 のスパイク `scripts/probe_ref2va_short.py` で品質成立を実証済み。
        README「スパイク: Ref2VA×超短尺」参照)。generate() の still と同じ3点セット
        (setup step の間だけの尺ゲート緩和・VAE 小クリップ修正・既存の decode 例外
        クリーンアップ) で動く。

        `seconds=None` is only valid when `references` carries exactly one audio-bearing
        reference (a lone audio reference, or a video reference with a soundtrack) -- the
        generated duration is then that reference's own, per
        `MiniMaxH3Ref2VASetupStep.__call__`. `height`/`width` default to MiniMax-H3's own
        16:9 canvas when left out (references never bind the target geometry -- each is
        prepared at its own resolution, see references.py's module docstring).

        Mirrors `generate()`'s structure closely (same FBC instrumentation, same
        bnb-4bit-mode decode-window transformer drop/reload pattern), but against
        `self._pipe_ref` / `transformer_ref` and the ref2va block set. Does not support
        `upscale` (hires-fix) -- out of scope for this task, and `_upscale_block_state_2x`
        assumes t2va's `num_condition_video_rows == 0`, which is never true here (a
        reference always adds condition rows).

        `cache`/`cache_threshold`/`attn`/`turbo`: same instant-apply overrides as
        `generate()` (see core/settings.py), applied to `transformer_ref` instead of
        `transformer`. `upscale` is not a parameter here at all (see above), so there is
        no upscale-vs-turbo interaction to validate on this path.

        Returns a dict with mp4_path, frame counts, timing and VRAM/RAM stats, in the
        same shape `generate()` returns (plus `references_summary`).

        PR #14355 (f37ab93) migration note: `self._pipe_ref` is now just an alias for
        `self._pipe` (see `_ensure_pipe_ref_shell`'s docstring) -- there is only ONE
        ModularPipeline shell, whose `_component_specs` already carries `transformer_ref`
        alongside `transformer`. `MiniMaxH3Ref2VACoreDenoiseStep`'s own block order
        (modular_blocks_minimax_h3.py) is `prepare_layout, prepare_condition_latents,
        prepare_latents, prepare_latents_ref2va, set_timesteps, denoise, after_denoise` --
        this method follows that order exactly (see `generate()`'s own fl2va comment on
        why `MiniMaxH3PrepareConditionLatentsStep` must run *before*
        `MiniMaxH3PrepareLatentsStep`, and `MiniMaxH3Ref2VAPrepareLatentsStep` after: the
        draw order is part of what the request's generator reproduces).
        `MiniMaxH3AfterDenoiseStep` (unpatchify) is inserted right before decode, same as
        `generate()`'s own t2va/fl2va path.
